  <h1> Voyant Visualization  </h1>
    
   
  <h2> Woman and the Republic, 
  By HELEN KENDRICK JOHNSON THE GUIDON CLUB NEW YORK 1913</h2>
   
    
    
  
    
  <p>The book I chose talks about women suffrage in United history.
  In twelve chapters the book proves the womenâ€™s suffrage relation to social acts from the government. </p>

 <p>As it is seen, the government has the power to state a law that prevents women's from work or practice their rights socially.
 It was surprising to me that the words church, husband, life and even sex was affected women's life at that time.</p>
