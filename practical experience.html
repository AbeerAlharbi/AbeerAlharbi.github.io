  <h3> ENGL 101 (Fall 2017) </h3>
  <h1>
  My main focus in my observations for this class is to see the developing of my skills as a teacher and and how I influenced by students and TA’s interaction inside classroom, by the way that I behave, response, think, and interact with others in the classroom. This paper aims to show evidence from the experienced situation that happened to me during observations. The significant impact was caused by indirect contribution form TAs that observing the same class and instructed by the same professor “Dr. Porter”.  This collaborating in my observations helped me to understand my role and responsibilities as a teacher, and also practical experiences of possible concerns that could affect my classroom and students in future career.
Some date of my weekly blogs will be analyzed to explain the outcomes of these experiences that has effects on my interactions as a teacher.
The way that other TAs affects my perspectives and has a great improve on my identity as a teacher. Meetings before or after class with other TAs on observations classes, and the way they behave inside class has unplanned impact on my believes and frames my understating of my rules as a teacher. This experience has enriched my personality in understanding my weakness to overcome and my strength to improve in a way that beneficial for my students and me.

  <h3> Academic literacy at ALI (Spring 2018)  </h3>
  <h1>
  My only concern after many classes I have observed and taught this semester is that if students would accept or interested in learning from a non-native teacher. I know I am not fluent in writing and speaking using the correct grammatical rules in English as a teacher should or would expect that from. My fear that students back in my country will be not excited to learn from a teacher with limited English proficiency. I know I can teach some particular skills and I can design and apply different method until my students get to learn what they need to learn, whoever I am worried about other aspects of that process would be discouraged me. I have a belief that a language teacher must know the language and speaks and write proficiency in that language and I know others will expect that too. I am not confident yet in going to a community would see me as a teacher who as they think can speak and writes very proficiency in English while I am not. I know there's a room for me in learning and improving myself as language speaker and a teacher, but I feel not ready that others in my country would understand that.
I was teaching a class that their English proficiency is considered advanced, but most of them didn’t speak a lot or express their ideas enough to understand. I know I will have the same level of students when teaching in my country, but what if I have another teacher, or a student consider very fluently in writing and speaking, or raised and porn in a native country and has the opportunity to learn in their public schools. I know it is good to have a student in that level of proficiency, how about the others? Will they compare the teacher and the student's proficiency in speaking or the way of pronunciation? I know I been trying to learn a lot, and when learning the other language, it's not only about one particular skill “speaking” but people will judge and make an impression that not accurate maybe by the way I speak or pronounce words. Perhaps I have good other skills as a teacher but am worried about others who think that language is all about speaking fluently.
