  <h2> HEART OF DARKNESS

  <p>The text I am going to analyze is a novel by a British writer. The story mainly told by a storyteller in his trip in a ship on Congo river. I choose to examine this text after I looked up many choices of text that I face difficulties to understand or to create a proper question to do this analyzation of a text. 
    I found it easy and very efficient to save the document and able to clean it up using TextEdit for mac.
 </p>

 <p>When I first see this result of most used words in the text, I realized that the use of feminine markers is less than male words in the whole document. Here you can see that the words [man-men-mr] are used more frequently in the text. The word "man" appeared 110 times in the text and as a plural "men" appears 51 times while there no appearance to any feminine words in the visual as the most frequently used words. 
My question that could came to my mind after seeing the result is to know the number of uses of feminine markers in the text comparing to the use of male words.

    <iframe style='width: 464px; height: 340px;' src='//voyant-tools.org/tool/Trends/?query=mistress&query=femele*&query=mrs*&query=women&query=woman&withDistributions=raw&docId=0c2566b0e73044311788341d5193e685&mode=document&corpus=3330e15b21fb6c08cb747a02fb070df7'></iframe>
    
    <p> Here I found the word woman as a singular and a plural use, shows no more than eight times in the text.
I tried to search other feminine words that could lead me to a possible conclusion, but no result founded.  </P>

 <p> After a more in-depth look at the text, I noticed that I missed looking at the word "girl" and I was excited to find new finding that this word shows equally seven times in the text. </p>

<p>I tried to look again at the text to know how precisely is the feminine markers is used in the text. I found that the word "mistress" which I think a charter has a connection with a main character in the story(I am not sure), and she shows up not more than in one situation in the story. 
  I think her connection wasn't very important to mention in the story that why it comes up only one time in the whole document.</p>
  
  <p> At the end, I can't see the exact reason behind using few feminine markers in the text, but it might be the place where the story was placed in or the community around him (when all men works or travel in the ship).</p>
