  <h1> Voyant Visualization  </h1>
      
  <h2> HEART OF DARKNESS
By Joseph Conrad
</h2>
   
    
    
  
    
  <p>The text I am going to analyze is a novel bu a British writer. The story basically told by a storyteller in his trip in a ship on congo river. I choose to analyze this text after I lokked up many choices of text that I face ddifficluties to understand or to creat a proper question to do this analyzation of a text.

I found it easy and very efficient to save the document and able to clean it up using TextEdit for mac.

 <p> When I first see this result of most used  words in the text, I relized that the use of other gender words than a male words in the whole document. Here you can see that the words [man-men-mr] is used more frequently in the text. Man appeed 110 times in the text and as aplural appers 51 times while there no apperense to any feminine words in the visual as the most frequent used words. 
My gquestion is to know the number of use of female words in the text comaring to the use of male words.
