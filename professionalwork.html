    <h2> Practical Experience at IUP </h2>
    <p style="text-align:justify;"> I had two classes at IUP that considered a perfect practical experience that helps me grow personally and proficiently as a teacher.</p>

     <h3> ENGL 101 (Fall 2017)</h3>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> My main focus in this class was to see the developing of my skills as a teacher and how I influenced by students and TA’s interaction inside classroom, by the way that I behave, response, think, and interact with others in the classroom. The significant impact was caused by indirect contribution form TAs that observing the same class and instructed by the same professor “Dr. Porter”. The collaborating in my observations helped me to understand my role and responsibilities as a teacher, and also practical experiences of possible concerns that could affect my classroom and students in future career.
The way that other TAs affects my perspectives and has a great improve on my identity as a teacher. Meetings before or after class with other TAs on observations classes, and the way they behave inside class has unplanned impact on my thoughts and frames my understating of my rules as a teacher. This experience has enriched my personality in understanding my weakness to overcome and my strength to improve in a way that beneficial for my students and me. </p>
  <h3> Academic literacy at ALI (Spring 2018) </h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;"> Graduate Assistant at American Language Institute at Indiana Univeristy of Pennsylavania. 
 <a href="  https://www.iup.edu/ali/"> ALI </a> 6850- Academic Literacy class T/TR (11-12:15).
          My role in this class is to assist the teacher in design and create a lesson plan and also teach a mini activity for each class as a practice for me.
    I was able to give feedback to students on their paper or their orally activates during the semester. At the end of the semester, I taught and designed a whole lesson for two classes.
